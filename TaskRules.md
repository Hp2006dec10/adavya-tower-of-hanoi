🗼 Event Plan: Tower of Hanoi Relay

## 🎯 Game Flow
- ​The game begins with all 5 disks stacked on the first peg.
- ​Teams must move the entire stack to the target peg following the standard rules:
    - Only one disk can be moved at a time.
    - Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty peg.
- ​No larger disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.

## 🏃 Relay Mechanism
**​One Move Per Person**: Participants must play in a relay format.
- ​Participant 1 makes one legal move, then immediately tags Participant 2.
- ​Participant 2 makes the next move and tags Participant 3, and so on.
- ​The cycle repeats (1-2-3-4-5-1...) until the tower is successfully rebuilt on the destination peg.
**​Reset Rule**: If a team makes an illegal move or gets stuck, they may "Reset" the game, but they must start back from Participant 1.

## ​✅ Team Progression
​Once the 5th disk is successfully placed on the target peg in the correct order, a volunteer will verify the completion.
​Upon verification, the entire team exits the room and proceeds to the next event.
